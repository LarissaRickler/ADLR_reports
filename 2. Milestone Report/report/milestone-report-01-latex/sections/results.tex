Based on 10,000 different random trajectories, we evaluated the proposed method (slow learning phase) with respect to the following performance criteria: achieved reward, success rate on reaching every point within the tolerance and completion time of successful flights.

In Figure \ref{fig:reward_slow} the reward per step is plotted. We observed an increasing reward in the first 500,000 steps. The value seems to have converged by then.
Next, the success rate is evaluated. The success rate increases in a fast pace. After 500,000 steps the rate already consistently reaches values up to 100\%, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:success_slow}.
We have also investigated the average completion time of a successful flight, visualized in Figure \ref{fig:time_slow}. The average time decreases and converges to approximately $6.5$s. Given that the average trajectory length is about $13.5$m in our experimental setup, the resulting average velocity of a successful episode is approximately $2.07\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$. A video of two successful example episodes can be found in \cite{slow_flight}.
