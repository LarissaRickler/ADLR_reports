As stated in the previous section, the drone performs well for the models trained with the scaled reward functions. However, in order to achieve the desired time optimality, an unscaled reward should be applied. Regarding the performance of time optimal training strategy, further investigations need to be conducted.

Once the 2D case is optimized, the achieved progress will be generalized to the case of 3D trajectories. By then, the drone's whole set of action (propellers and flaps) will be unlocked, aiming to achieve time optimality using the full potential of the drone.
