\begin{abstract}
We aim to minimize the flight time of a VTOL drone through a sequence of waypoints. We are planning to utilize deep reinforcement learning methods to train a robust neural network controller.

Milestone Report and Presentation
Your milestone report should be one page and answer the following questions:

1. What experiments have you conducted so far?

2. Are there any changes to the research hypothesis or problem statement from the proposal?

The milestone report must report on at least one experiment that you have done since the proposal. This experiment does not need to be successful, but you should have attempted something. If it did not work as expected, you should briefly discuss why. You are encouraged to include a plot or figure.

In addition, you have to do a milestone presentation (8min talk +3min Q&A) in a Zoom meeting, presenting your project idea and the first results to the whole class.

One report and presentation is required per team (each team member should do about half of the presentation).


Piazza:
Your milestone report should be 1 - 2 (max) pages and answer the following questions:
1. What has been done so far? (tools decided on, implementations, overview on methods, â€¦)
2. First Results (e.g., some raw plots)
(no explicit introduction, because you described your topic already in the proposal)

The milestone report must report on at least one experiment that you have done since the proposal. This experiment does not need to be successful, but you should have attempted something. If it did not work as expected, you should briefly discuss why. You are encouraged to include a plot or figure.
