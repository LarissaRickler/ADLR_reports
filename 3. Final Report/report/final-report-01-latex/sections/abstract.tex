We tackle the problem of minimum-time flight for a quadrotor through a sequence of waypoints while exploiting the quadrotor dynamics. We implemented a low-level neural network controller that uses deep reinforcement learning methods. The controller enables a drone to faithfully follow a path through a sequence of waypoints, while minimizing the required time for completion. We developed a completely learned policy, which measures inputs from its environment and performs all flight maneuvers without the need of an additional low-level PID controller.
